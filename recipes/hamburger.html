    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These hamburgers are a huge improvement on the normal, plain hamburger. I think that is what is making all of those cows so mad! These bad boys leave room for improvisation too; if you don't have all of the ingredients, be creative! Serve on buns with all the fixin's.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef and taco seasoning together in a bowl with your hands. Separate mixture into 5 equal portions. Form into patties.</li>
